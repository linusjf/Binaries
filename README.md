# Binaries

This repository contains a collection of my shell scripts designed to streamline and simplify common tasks when working with\
bash, git, and other command-line tools and utilities.

## Features

- **Automation**: Scripts to automate repetitive tasks
- **Productivity**: Tools to enhance command-line efficiency
- **Cross-platform**: Designed to work across different Unix-like systems
- **Customization**: Easily adaptable to individual workflows

## Usage

To use these scripts:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/linusjf/binaries.git ~/binaries`
2. Add the `binaries` directory to your PATH: `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/binaries"` at the end. You don't want any of\
   the scripts to override any installed programs.
3. Make scripts executable: `chmod +x ~/binaries/*`

## Contributing

Contributions are not welcome! But you can follow these guidelines for your own scripts:

- Keep scripts focused on a single purpose
